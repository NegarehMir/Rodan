                    <p>To have a better understanding of how Rodan works, let's take a look at the softwares it uses.</p>

                    <p>Now let's take a look at rodan's most important models:</p>
                    <center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}img/rodan-model.png"/ border="0" style="max-width:100%"></center>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Each Project is created by a User. In each Project, You can upload Resources or a group of Resources (a ResourceList). A ResourceType is assigned to each Resource. ResourceTypes include text, image, midi, zip, etc</p>
                    <p>Rodan uses different Job packages from other applications. It also has a few basic built-in Jobs. Some examples include convertions using PIL package such as conversion to PNG, TIF, JPEG2000. Each Job can get zero or more InputPortType and one or more OutputPortType.</p>
                    <p>You can create a Workflow in workflow tab, importing one or many Jobs which creates WorkflowJobs. Each WorkflowJob which present the imported Job and will have zero or many InputPorts and one or many OutputPorts. These ports will have the same ResourceType as the original Job. You can connect these jobs together in the Workflow. A connection happens between an OutputPort of a WorkflowJob and InputPort of another one only when they have the same ResourceType. An InputPort without a Resource assigned will result in the Workflow being 'invalid' and Workflow cannot be run.</p>
                    <p>Running a Workflow will produce a WorkflowRun and one RunJob for each of its WorkflowJobs. Each RunJob uses assigned Resources as its inputs and will produce one or more Resources as Outputs when the WorkflowRun is finished running. You can check the status of the WorkflowRun in WorkflowRun tab or you can see the status of each RunJob. The status can be PROCESSING, FAILED, FINISHED, etc.</p>
